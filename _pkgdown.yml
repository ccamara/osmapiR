    To make it easier to identify related changes the concept of changesets was introduced. Every modification of the
    standard OSM elements has to reference an open changeset. A changeset may contain tags just like the other elements.
    A recommended tag for changesets is the key ''comment=*'' with a short human readable description of the changes
    being made in that changeset, similar to a commit message in a revision control system. A new changeset can be
    opened at any time and a changeset may be referenced from multiple API calls. Because of this it can be closed
    manually as the server can't know when one changeset ends and another should begin. To avoid stale open changesets a
    mechanism is implemented to automatically close changesets. See
    [OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Changeset) for details.

    In violation of the [GPX standard](https://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/1/#type_trksegType) when downloading public GPX
    traces through the API, all waypoints of non-trackable traces are randomized (or rather sorted by lat/lon) and
    delivered as one trackSegment for privacy reasons. Trackable traces are delivered, sorted by descending upload time,
    before the waypoints of non-trackable traces.
